# Analyzing Crops Water Consumption over its Seasonal Cylce

### Purpose
Simulating data to create a model to analyze water usage of plants/crops during its seasonal cycle:

1) Simulate Data to replicate a typical plant water-use curve

2) Add noise to the graph and N amount of sensors (increase dataset)

3) Create a model using the simulated data

4) Use model on real data and make predictions using the data output
